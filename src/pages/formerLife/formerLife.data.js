  p1: `After spending a summer volunteering in Uganda during my junior year of college,
  I officially caught the "travel bug" and was hooked on international work for social good.
  I went back to Uganda for a full year immediately following my undergrad, followed by an additional year and
  a half in Cali, Colombia while also remotely earning my Masters in International Relations.
  After completing my post-grad degree, I lived in Sudan and South Sudan for 2 years and an additional 4 years in Washington DC
    before stumbling upon Charleston by chance. `,
  p2: `    Professionally during that decade I was always in some capacity designing data collection
    and analysis systems for both qualitative and quantitive undertakings.  This work mostly took place
    under the category of program and/or project evaluation.  In laymans terms, when non-profits wanted
    to win or keep funding I designed the data systems and analysis to either help them better understand and assess their impact of
    social change in the community.  Often I also helped funders evaluate whether these projects were indeed creating the
    lasting and impactful social behavioural change for sustainable community improvement that they intended.`,
  p3: `During that time I worked mostly in Advanced Excel.  But over the final years I started to move
    from Tableau, Power BI, and Excel, onto more technical statistical analysis packages like STATA and R
    programming.  It was during this transition to using more sophisticated statistical analysis tools that
    I started to discover my newfound passion for programming. I remember saying repeatedly in DC and abroad
    how "I wished I could get on projects where all I did was work in STATA and R programming".  Then it finally hit me that it
    might be time for a serious career change.  After visitng a friend in Charleston and seeking out
    information about JRS code school in Shem Creek, I made the easy, yet drastic, pivot to change my
    whole life.  Now 3 and a half years later I can hontesly still say I've never once regretted the change and
    it's one of the best decisions I've ever made.  Software development is my perfect match and
        I'm grateful daily (well when I'm not stuck!) to have found this exciting career.   See below more detailed descriptions per each position where I worked before starting code camp, if curious.`,
