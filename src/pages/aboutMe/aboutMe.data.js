    `Shortly after moving to Mount Pleasant 3 and a half years ago, I met my husband
    to be and knew that I'd never want to leave. We just recentely
    bought our new family home in Mount Pleasant and we feel
    blessed daily to have found our own piece of heaven on this earth.`,

    `Both personally and professionaly, I'm the type of person who is
    addicted to learning and trying new things. I'm contanstly pushing
    my team to use the most progressive code standards and libraries;
    partly because I think it's important but partly because if I'm
    not being challenged and learning every week of my life, then I'm
    not being authentic myself. When software development fell into my lap, I knew
    right away that it was the perfect fit to my obsession with
    self-improvement and constant desire to learn more.`,

    `Being the 2nd of 7 children, I'm a natural self-starter who
    enjoys leadership roles. I hold myself to a high standard, both with
    my work quality and how I treat others. I also hold my
    team and bosses to those same standards, so I only wish to work for teams that emphasize kindness, respect, quality, progressive code standards, and peer-to-peer learning above all
    other things. Life is short so I intend to enjoy every year of
    this life surrounded by optimistic and genuine people both inside
    the office and out.`
