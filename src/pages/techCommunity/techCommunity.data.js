      gridDescription: [`Shortly after moving Charleston in 2017, I began attending any and every tech meetup.  Early on I noticed something odd; I had met so many people and yet not a single female software engineer.  In my former life of non-profit jobs where I worked in a female-dominated industry,I had immensely enjoyed growing professionally alongside other like-minded driven women.  I still craved that inspiring female comradery and after learning that female software engineers make up approximately 15% of the development community, I felt encouraged to the CHS Women Devs group to find some of these other people that fell in this 15%.`,
      `Charleston Women Devs has been going strong since the summer of 2018 and to date we are still doing 2 meetups a month (1 online for technical topics and 1 outdoors for the happy hour during these COVID 19 days).  It's been a uniquly wonderful experience to create a causual group of female software engineers that would rarely get to talk code with friends in our normal out-of-work settings.  It's now mostly a sisterhood of developers to lean on and just enjoy one another's company.  We seek eachother's mentorship and ideas to continue building a solid career path.`

      gridDescription: [`In 2019 I had the pleasure of acting as the CHSWIT Mentorship Program Coordinator.
      The program had gone silent for a couple of years so I volunteered to take the lead and bring it back to life.
      Working alongside CHSWIT Board Members Nina Magnesson and Valerie Sessions, I paired over 100 women in tech with peer
      support and mentorship in their own specific CHS neighborhoods and directly in a chosen career area of interest.  We further organized a
      large kickoff event at the College Of Charleston with breakout sessions, a panel of experts, a dinner, and
      cocktail hour overlooking the river.  Today this program is still going strong thanks to our efforts in 2019 and am grateful to have had the opportunity to meet countless phenomenol women in tech in the Charleston area.`],
