      gridDescription: [`Shortly after moving to Charleston in 2017, I began attending any and every tech meetup.  
      Early on I noticed something odd; I had met so many people and yet not a single female software engineer. 
      In my former life of non-profit jobs where I worked in a female-dominated industry, I had always enjoyed growing 
      professionally alongside other like-minded driven women.  I craved that inspiring female comradery and after learning 
      that female software engineers make up approximately 15% of the development community, I felt encouraged to create the 
      Charleston Women Devs group to find some of these other women.`,
      `Charleston Women Devs has been going strong since the summer of 2018 and to date we are still doing 2 meetups a month 
      (1 online for technical topics and 1 outdoors for a happy hour during these COVID-19 days).  
      It's been an unique and wonderful experience to create a casual group of female software engineers that would rarely 
      get to talk code with friends in our normal out-of-work settings.  
      It's now mostly a sisterhood of developers to lean on, share new technical concepts, seek our advice for professional growth and simply enjoy one another's company.`

      gridDescription: [`In 2019, I had the pleasure of acting as the CHSWIT Mentorship Program Coordinator.
      The program had gone silent for a couple of years so I volunteered to take the lead and bring it back to life.
      Working alongside CHSWIT Board Members Nina Magnesson and Valerie Sessions, I paired over 100 women in tech with peer
      support and mentorship in their own specific CHS neighborhoods and in a shared chosen career area of interest.  I further organized a
      large kickoff event at the College of Charleston with breakout sessions, a panel of experts, a dinner and
      cocktail hour overlooking the river for all of the 100+ mentorship participants.  Today this program is still going strong thanks to our efforts in 2019 and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to meet countless phenomenol women in tech in the Charleston area from this experience.`],
